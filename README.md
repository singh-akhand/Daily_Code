# Daily Code

This repository contains my daily coding exercises. Each day, I upload a folder named based on the day (e.g., `day 0 of code`, `day 1 of code`, etc.), and inside each folder, I include a `code.txt` file with the code I worked on for that day.

## Structure

Daily_Code/ ├── day 0 of code/ │ └── code.txt ├── day 1 of code/ │ └── code.txt └── ...

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document my daily coding progress as I practice new concepts, solve problems, and improve my coding skills over time.
